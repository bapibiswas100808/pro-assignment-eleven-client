# About My Project:

- Modern Front-End with React.js: The client-side is built using React.js, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience.

- Robust Back-End with MongoDB & Node.js: I used MongoDB for database needs and Node.js with Express for efficient and scalable server-side operations.

- Secure Authentication: User authentication is handled securely using Google Firebase and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- Stylish and Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI are used to create a stylish, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

- Enhanced User Interaction: Integrated with npm packages like framer motion, react-typewriter, react-tooltip, SweetAlert2, and react-hot-toast to provide engaging notifications and tooltips.

- Comprehensive Service Management: Users can easily add, read, update, and delete services, ensuring complete control over their event management needs.
